# Book Library
Book Library for internship as Visma

In this app you can view library books through the console.

**How to use it:**

- Write "Help" if you want to see all created commands.
- Write "List" and dialogue will pop up. Just press enter to skip filtering. Then you will see all library books.
If you want to filter the list, choose one of the given filters and in the next dialogue write down the key. List will be filtered based on 
chosen filter and key value.
- Write "Add" to add new book to the list. Then dialogue will pop up. Fill in all required information. Then your book will be added.
- Write "Take" to take a book from the library. When dialogue pops up, add required information. You cann't take more than 3 books.
- Write "Return" to return taken book. In dialogue, write the book name you have taken. If you are late, then library grandma will be angry at you.
- Write "Delete" to delete chosen book. Add book name and ISBN to delete book.

**Challenges I faced while doing this task:**
- At first I chose wrong command line reading method. It wasn't intuitive and it was miserable to use it. Then I changed it to a dialogue type of command.
- I think I expanded my task too much. I should have made it a bit more simple. Thus I was sitting for about 6 hours on the project. 
- Should have taken more time to do tests.
